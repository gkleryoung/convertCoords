    "# Interconversion of cartesian and internal coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "Internal coordinates are an popular method for defining molecular structures. Their utility lies in providing a definition of geometry which is independent of a molecule's position in cartesian space, and thus easily comparable. Additionally, internal coordinates directly contain relevant about molecules (i.e., bond lengths and bond angles), allowing certain properties to be fixed as constant during a quantum chemistry calculation (e.g. enforcing symmetry by fixing bond angles).<sup>1</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common format for specifying internal coordinates is the Z-matrix, which consists of one row per atom in a molecule, with the following basic format:\n",
